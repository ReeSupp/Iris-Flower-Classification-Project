Iris Flower Classification

Objective: Classify iris flowers into species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on petal and sepal measurements.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Support Vector Machine (SVM), GridSearchCV.

Data Handling: Use Pandas for loading and exploring the dataset.

Data Visualization: Utilize Seaborn and Matplotlib for plotting pairplots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Modeling: Implement Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to optimize SVM parameters for improved accuracy.

Outcome: Build an effective model to classify iris species and understand feature importance through visualizations.
